# Student Report Card (Dart Project)

This Dart project calculates a student's total and average marks, checks if they passed, and prints a well-formatted report using what Iâ€™ve learned today.

## Concepts Used:
- Null safety (`String?`, `??`)
- `const`, `final`, and `late`
- Arithmetic & logical operators
- Conditional expression (`? :`)
- Cascades (`..`)
- Basic Dart structure

## How to Run

1. Make sure Dart is installed: https://dart.dev/get-dart
2. Open terminal and navigate to the project folder.
3. Run:

```bash
dart lib/main.dart
